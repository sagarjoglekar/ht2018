<h2>About</h2>
                        <p>The ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media (HT) is a premium venue for high quality peer-reviewed research on theory,
                          systems and applications for hypertext and social media. The conference would be held in the beautiful city of Baltimore this year.
                          HyperText is concerned with all aspects of modern hypertext research,
                          including social media, adaptation, personalization, recommendations, user modeling, linked data and semantic web, dynamic and
                          computed hypertext, and its application in digital humanities, as well as with interplay between those aspects such as linking
                          stories with data or linking people with resources. HT2017 will focus on the role of links, linking,
                          hypertext and hyperlink theory on the web and beyond, as a foundation for approaches and practices in the wider community.
                          Therefore, HT2017 has the following tracks:
                          <li> Hyper-Society covers digital humanities and connecting/connected people </li>
                          <li> Hyper-Data covers connected things on the documents, Web, and IoT </li>
                          <li> Hyper-Media covers connected traditional and non-traditional media </li>
                          <li>Social Networks and Digital Humanities (Linking people)</li>
                          <li>Semantic Web and Linked Data (Linking data)</li>
