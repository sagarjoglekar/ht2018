<h2>About</h2>
                        <p>The ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media (HT) is a premium venue for high quality peer-reviewed research on theory,
                          systems and applications for hypertext and social media. The conference would be held in the beautiful city of Baltimore this year.
                          HyperText is concerned with all aspects of modern hypertext research,
                          including social media, adaptation, personalization, recommendations, user modeling, linked data and semantic web, dynamic and
                          computed hypertext, and its application in digital humanities, as well as with interplay between those aspects such as linking
                          stories with data or linking people with resources. HT2017 will focus on the role of links, linking,
                          hypertext and hyperlink theory on the web and beyond, as a foundation for approaches and practices in the wider community.
                          Therefore, HT2017 has the following tracks:
                          <li> Hyper-Society covers digital humanities and connecting/connected people </li>
                          <li> Hyper-Data covers connected things on the documents, Web, and IoT </li>
                          <li> Hyper-Media covers connected traditional and non-traditional media </li>
                          <li>Social Networks and Digital Humanities (Linking people)</li>
                          <li>Semantic Web and Linked Data (Linking data)</li>
                          <li>Adaptive Hypertext and Recommendations (Linking resources)</li>

	    <h2>Call for Research Papers</h2>
        <h3><a name="social_networks" id="cfp_social_networks">Social Networks and Digital Humanities (Linking people)</a></h3>

        <p>We invite original submissions addressing all aspects of social networks and digital humanities. Social networks and social media allow numerous users to participate in production and consumption of online information by establishing new links between people, information, and services. Users participating in such online endeavours leave digital traces on the Web, which provides unparalleled research opportunities for studying questions in sociology, psychology, behavioral science, political and economic science, and many others.</p>
        <p>While studying human digital traces have received attention from different communities, understanding human social behavior via unobtrusive methods (i.e. methods where the researcher doesn't intrude into the research context) remains a challenging endeavor and an open problem. Tackling these challenges requires the development of new methods, instruments and techniques as well as an interdisciplinary effort from researchers across disciplines such as computer science, humanities, social sciences and others. This track seeks original submissions on either methods or practices at the crossroads of these various disciplines. </p>

        <h3><a name="semantic_web" id="cfp_semantic_web">Semantic Web and Linked Data (Linking data)</a></h3>

        <p>The last few years have seen an uptake in semantically enriched data in a wide variety of Web content and Web services.  Currently, many new services and applications utilize those data to provide new and more efficient features to their users. </p>
        <p>This surge of use of Semantic Web standards and Linked data has the potential of generating limitless semantic networks, rich in meaning and structure. The goal of this track is to focus research on the challenges and opportunities associated with realizing and using such wide scale and heterogeneous semantic data networks, that can also encompass real-world data merged with or linked to online content and documents.</p>

        <h3><a name="adaptive_hypertext" id="cfp_adaptive_hypertext">Adaptive Hypertext and Recommendations (Linking resources)</a></h3>

        <p>In modern Web environments hypertext content is increasingly generated, processed, filtered, adjusted, and personalized by for example recommendations. Online social networks further generalize the conventional notion of the hypertext to imply and recommend connections between users via their content and media. Making sense of these complex processes has attracted significant attention in various research disciplines.</p>
        <p>This track targets developing deeper insights into the mechanisms of information generation and dissemination, characterization of evolutionary processes on online social networks, studies of models and systems that support these processes, and the broader implications of these for organisations and society. The track provides a forum for researchers and practitioners to exchange information regarding advancements in the current state of art.</p>
        <p>Addressing problems in the adaptive hypertext and recommendations space necessitates expertise in several domains: Computer and Information Science, Social Sciences, Psychology, and Economics. Hence submissions of inter-disciplinary works are highly encouraged. We also welcome works that explore how adaptive hypertext and recommendations can be applied in diverse domains, such as Education, Health, Journalism, Government, Environment, and Media.</p>
        <p>Topics of interest of the track include (but are not limited to):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Adaptive authoring and design of hypermedia</li>
            <li>Adaptive hypertext frameworks and toolkits</li>
            <li>Community and social circle evolution</li>

    <div class="workshop" style="display:none;">
	    <h2>Call for Workshop Papers</h2>
        <p>The goals of the workshops are to provide a more informal setting for exchanging opinions, to share experiences, presenting ideas, foster the research community and identify open problems and/or explore directions for future research. As such, they also offer a good opportunity for researchers to present their work and to obtain feedback from an interested community in an interactive atmosphere. Proposals are especially encouraged on emerging topics, related to the main conference themes, but may also include other (novel) topics, which might be of interest for the hypertext community.</p>
        <p>Acceptance of workshop proposals will be based on the experience and background of the organizers in the topic, and on the relevance of the subject matter with regard to the topics addressed in the main conference. We welcome proposals for different types of workshops, from working groups on a specific topic to more traditional conference-like workshops. However, we prefer “interactive” workshops that guarantee richer active interactions among participants and provide significant room for controversial and stimulating discussions. Potential proposers are invited to discuss their ideas with the workshop chair before working out a detailed proposal.</p>
